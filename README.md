# Quality control for whole-genome sequencing data

This repository compiles a series of scripts to perform thorough quality control (QC) on whole-genome sequencing data in a VCF format. 


This pipeline builds on the initial QC methods used in the paper:
Acosta-Uribe, J., Aguill√≥n, D., Cochran, J.N. et al. A neurodegenerative disease landscape of rare mutations in Colombia due to founder effects. Genome Med 14, 27 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-022-01035-9


## Description

Genome sequencing (WGS) was performed at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology on either the Illumina HiSeq X platform, or the Illumina NovaSeq platform. A subset of individuals was sequenced at the Human Longevity Institute on the Illumina HiSeq X platform (119 samples).
Sequencing libraries at HudsonAlpha were prepared by Covaris shearing, end repair, adapter ligation, and PCR using standard protocols. Library concentrations were normalized using KAPA qPCR prior to sequencing. 

The TANGL dataset presented in our Genome Medicine paper was re-aligned to hg38 and processed as follows:

Sequencing reads from both centers were aligned to the hg38 reference genome

with bwa-0.7.12 BAMs were sorted and duplicates were marked with Sambamba 0.5.4  Indels were realigned, bases were recalibrated, and gVCFs were generated with GATK 3.3 Variants were called across all samples in a single batch with GATK 3.8 using the -newQual flag to minimize false negative singleton calls. The recall rate for GATK against truth sets is between 93-99%  for single nucleotide variants and 85 and 98% for small (less than 50 bp) indel events. Genome annotation was performed using SnpEff 4.3 after splitting multi-allelic sites with Vt. The genome was annotated with the gene definitions from human genome build Ensembl GRCh37.75. All single nucleotide variants and indels were annotated with CADD v1.3. Population database frequency annotations included 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (1000GP), TOPMed Bravo (lifted over from hg38 to hg19 using CrossMap 0.2.7), and several population database sets annotated using WGSA 0.7 including ExAC, gnomAD, ESP, and UK10K. Variants were also annotated with dbSNP release 151.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* bcftools https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html
* vcftools https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html
* plink https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/
* King https://www.kingrelatedness.com/


### Installing

* The scripts presented here are provided as a QC pipeline guide, rather than a plug and play script. There are steps that require a 'manual evaluation', and as many scripts, it needs to be tuned according to the user needs.

### Running

This pipeline is divided into steps. Each step comprises a series of commands and a series of data-visualization scripts at each checkpoint.

0. **KNOW YOUR DATASET**\
      0.a:  Use vcftools and bcftools to get general statistics 
			
      0.b:  Generate plots to observe data distribution and quality [Fundamental for using this pipeline on another dataset]

1. **SOFT QUALITY CONTROL**\
      1.a:Divide your data into Autosomes and Sex chromosomes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter individuals with autosomal missingness higher than 10%. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter autosomal sites with missingness higher than 10% 
          
      1.b: Generate plots to observe data distribution and quality
   
The **STRINGENT QUALITY CONTROL** is divided into the following steps:


2. **CHROMOSOMAL SEX CHECK**
3. **SITE QUALITY FILTERING** 
4. **INDIVIDUAL QUALITY FILTERING**
5. **GENERATE PLINK FILES**
6. **RELATIONSHIP INFERENCE AND MENDEL ERRORS**
7. **STRINGENT MISSINGNESS QC**
8. **GENERAL REPORT OF POST QC STATISTICS**
9. **PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO DETECT BATCH EFFECTS**
